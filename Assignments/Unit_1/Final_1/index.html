	<h3>HOW WE BEGAN</h3>
	<p style= "font-size:30px" "width=500px">Since 2011, CURYJ has been building community relationships and mobilizing young leaders to organize and create in the movement to end mass incarceration and youth criminalization. CURYJ was born when our co-founders, who lived through the impacts of systemic violence and incarceration, set out to beautify their neighborhood, engage youth in the area and coordinate pro-bono legal defense for local defendants in the Fruitvale gang injunctions.

As defendants and supporters of those targeted by the gang injunction, the five co-founders became powerful advocates at the state capitol and locally, speaking on issues impacting boys and men of color. Early in the journey, CURYJ formed coalitions and partnerships to repeal Prop 21, successfully ending gang injunctions in California and initiated the Aztl√°n Beautification Movement (ABM) to spread culture and healing art in the streets of Oakland.

What had been created went far beyond defeating the gang injunctions, and CURYJ became a family, a safe place and a platform for building community. CURYJ has created opportunities and programming for youth to build their own futures and transform community through culturally rooted healing, relationship building and systems impacted youth-led activism.
